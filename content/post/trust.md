What is something we find in a successful team? Is it diversity? or something else?
<!--more-->

After working a couple of decades in Software Engineering both as Individual Contributor and few times in management, I often think deeply about how to keep the culture of my teams at the best. Culture is a variable and not a constant. It changes with time and maturity of team/company etc., For eg. a startup may have different set of values vs that of a huge enterprise. But people give their best when they work with people whom they "Trust".  

### Trust
Trust - firm belief in the character, strength, or truth of someone or something, is usually unspoken but felt by humans when they collaborate. It makes people to be positive and focus on their work without questioning everything. People feel happier, chase their dreams without feeling insecure. It also makes them secure & fearless - lets them take more risks without worrying about results. A team without trust isn't really a team. It is just a group of individuals, working, often not making progress. They may not share information, they might fight over roles & responsibilities and often try to pull one another. It doesn't matter how capable or talented they are, they wouldn't reach their full potential if trust isn't present.

However, when trust is in place, each individual in the team becomes stronger, because they are part of an effective, cohesive group. When people trust one another, the group can achieve truly meaningful goals.

High-functioning teams achieve greater levels of participation and collaboration because their members trust one another with strong sense of team identity. They have confidence in their abilities and effectiveness and high levels of EQ.

By the way, Trust is a necessary trait in any team - not specific to just Engineering teams.
