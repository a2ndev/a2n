Engineers do not like to be called/treated as resources. How to treat them to get highly productive teams?

<!--more-->
If you are in a Software Development project and you are part of Product/Marketing/Content or a team other than Product Development(PD), you might have noticed everyone talks about PD team members as **resources**. You tend to agree - because end of the day for whatever decisions you make - the bulk of the implementation may be done by PD team. And they are the work resources.

But, Engineers do not want to be called/known/treated as Resources. They like to own the product just like you & want to contribute to Product decisions. In a way, this is good - then they may feel more accountable & responsible for the Product they are building. Note that they are not being outsourced for implementing your dreams. They too are part of your dreams & together you are building this product.

Here are some tips to make PD Team productive

* Include them in your thought process.
* Listen to their ideas, thinking, concerns or other perspectives - treat them as early customer of the product.
* You may agree/disagree with their thought process, but discussion is important.
* Since, they contributed to early research/analysis & design of the product - they feel more empowered
* Everyone will align on the iterative style of pushing product to Customers from MVP to Delightful Product.
* In fact, there are high chances that they innovate and present you something better than you were envisioning.
* More importantly this whole practice will make you feel - they are not resources, but integral part of your team.
