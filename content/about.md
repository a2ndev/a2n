Random thoughts distributed! is a collection of my thoughts. These are purely mine &  don't represent opinions of employer I work for.

I have been working in Software Industry for a couple of decades now. I feel lucky to work with several smart minds & grow (old) with them! My work is mainly about serverside applications | backend. I do have opinions about front end with familiarity - but I am no expert there. However on the server side, I passionaltely design, build & break stuff with all the support from my team..
